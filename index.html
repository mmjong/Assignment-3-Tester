<p>
  Hi there, my name is Maddie! I am currently a second year in the GBDA program at the University of Waterloo. I moved from Markham, Ontario to Stratford in order to study at the campus! 
  </p>
  <p> 
    I have 2 older siblings, making me the youngest. I also have a white German Shepherd named Jax, who is 4 years old. 
      </p>
  <p>
        My favourite season is Fall, since all the leaves turn into pretty colours, and the weather is just right for me.  
My favourite colour is red, specifically dark red.

   <img src="family.jpeg" style= width:450px;height: 400px; alt="my family"                                                                                                             
<p>
  I am half Japanese and Chinese! I was born in Canada along with my two older siblings; Ethan and Emily. For about 8 years, we lived in the smallest country in South America: Suriname. When my family and I were on vacation in Canada, my father suddenly announced we were going to stay here- indefinitely. 
  Canada became our new home. I had to grow accustom to the new weather, the people, the culture, and even the food!

<p>
I really enjoy cooking and baking! In fact, I had wanted to go to chefâ€™s school instead of university. I especially love cooking for my family. These are some of my favourite dishes I've made!
  </p>
  <p>
    I love travelling! It allows me to experience new cultures, foods, and even people. My favourite trip was going to Norway!
